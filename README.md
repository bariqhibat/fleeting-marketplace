# Fleeting Marketplace

## Description

A web application for real-time pricing marketplace.

## Technologies

1. Frontend:
   - NextJS
1. Backend:
   - RESTful APIs
   - gRPC APIs
     > with protobuf as interface definition language (IDL)

## Learning Paths

Walkthrough to microservices. Using Golang to develop RESTful API, gRPC service, with (hopefully) Envoy Proxy, Docker, and Kubernetes.
Hopes to:

1. Use Envoy Proxy
1. Use Docker/Kubernetes
1. Use gRPC client to try bi-directional streaming
1. (cont.) Connect microservice to NextJS
1. (cont.) Use bi-directional in NextJS to get real-time pricing dashboard
1. Use message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka/Redis) as a event-bus
1. and try other microservices know-hows!
